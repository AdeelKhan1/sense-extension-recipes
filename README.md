# Qlik Sense Extension Playground

While working a lot with the concept of Extension in Qlik Sense I thought it helps other people to share not only production-ready extensions but also some experiments, prototypes, etc.

So this is more or less my playground to test concepts, to test how the Visualization Extension API for Qlik Sense is documented, etc.
