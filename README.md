# Qlik Sense Extension Playground

While working a lot with the concept of Extension in Qlik Sense I thought it helps other people to share not only production-ready extensions but also some experiments, prototypes, etc.

# Samples

* **[HyperCubeOnTheFly](https://github.com/stefanwalther/qsExtensionPlayground/tree/master/HyperCubeOnTheFly)**
	* Create a HyperCube on the fly, based on dimensions and measures defined in the property panel.


Read the README.md located in every sample for more information.
